# Sorter
 
A sorter for anything, inspired by the Touhou Character Sorter (https://tohosort.frelia.my/).  
Works by asking the user to compare between two things at a time.  
It's not that deep. Put your items to be compared in SorterInput.txt, run Sorter.java, and the output will appear in SorterOutput.txt.  
Relatively barebones, but it works.
